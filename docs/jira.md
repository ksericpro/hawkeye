# introduction

Jira is a powerful project management tool used by teams to plan, track, and manage their work. It's highly customizable and is widely used for agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban.


# How to Use Jira
Using Jira typically involves a few key steps:

## projects
Create a Project: The first thing you do is create a project, which serves as a container for all your related work. You can choose from templates like Scrum or Kanban, depending on your team's workflow.


## issues
Create Issues: Issues are the fundamental building blocks of work in Jira. They can represent tasks, bugs, user stories, or any other work item. You create issues and add details like a summary, description, and assignee.



Organize Work: You organize and prioritize issues in a backlog. This backlog is a list of all the work that needs to be done. For a Scrum project, you then create sprints, which are fixed time periods (e.g., two weeks) where you complete a subset of the backlog.



Track Progress: As work progresses, you move issues across a board, which visually represents your workflow. For example, you might have columns for "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."

Collaborate and Report: Jira provides tools for team collaboration, such as commenting on issues and mentioning team members. You can also generate various reports and use a dashboard to get a high-level overview of your project's progress and team's performance.


## Plan, Projects, and Dashboards in Jira
Plan (Advanced Roadmaps): The "Plan" feature, also known as Advanced Roadmaps (available in Jira Premium), is a high-level planning tool. It's designed for managing work across multiple teams and projects. With Advanced Roadmaps, you can:


Visualize the Big Picture: Create a comprehensive timeline to see how large initiatives and epics are progressing across different teams.

Manage Dependencies: Identify and track dependencies between tasks and teams to prevent bottlenecks.

Plan Capacity: Assess whether teams have the bandwidth to complete the work they've been assigned, helping with resource management.

Scenario Planning: Create and explore different versions of your plan without affecting the live data.

Projects: A project is a container for all the work related to a specific product, service, or initiative. When you create a project, you choose a template that determines the default workflow and features. The main types are:

Software Projects: Designed for development teams, these include features like backlogs, sprints, and integrations with code repositories.

Business Projects: Ideal for non-technical teams like marketing, HR, or finance, offering simpler views like lists, calendars, and timelines.

Service Management Projects: Used by IT and support teams to manage customer requests and incidents.

Dashboards: A dashboard is a customizable homepage that provides a quick, visual overview of your projects. They are built using gadgets, which are small, modular components that display specific data from your Jira projects. You can have multiple dashboards, each tailored for a different purpose, such as:


Team Performance: A dashboard showing a team's workload, completed tasks, and bug resolution rates.

Sprint Progress: A dashboard with a burndown chart to track the progress of a current sprint.

High-Priority Issues: A dashboard that lists all urgent tasks and bugs across multiple projects.


## HAW vs SCRUM

"HAW vs SCRUM in plan" seems to be a slight misunderstanding of project management terminology. There is no widely recognized project management methodology or framework called "HAW." It's possible "HAW" is an acronym or a term specific to a particular organization, but it's not a standard practice like Scrum.

Let's break down the common project management concepts you might be thinking of and compare them to Scrum.

1. Scrum
Scrum is an Agile framework for managing complex projects, particularly in software development. It's a highly prescriptive methodology with defined roles, events, and artifacts.

Key components of Scrum:

Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team.

Events (Ceremonies): Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum (Stand-up), Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.

Artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Increment (the potentially shippable product).

Sprints: Work is done in short, fixed-length iterations, typically 1-4 weeks.

Scrum in "Plan":
In the context of "plan," Scrum's planning is done in a structured, iterative way:

Product Backlog: The Product Owner maintains a prioritized list of all the work that needs to be done. This is the overarching "plan" for the product.

Sprint Planning: At the beginning of each sprint, the team selects a subset of the Product Backlog to complete. They create a Sprint Backlog and commit to a Sprint Goal. This is the detailed "plan" for the current sprint.

Daily Scrums: The team has a short daily meeting to plan their work for the next 24 hours and identify any obstacles.

2. HAW (Likely a Misnomer for "How")
The term "HAW" may have been a typo for "How" in the context of "What vs. How." This is a key distinction often made in Agile and Scrum.

The "What": This is the responsibility of the Product Owner. They define what needs to be built. They are concerned with the product's vision, features, and prioritization based on business value. They manage the "What" through the Product Backlog.

The "How": This is the responsibility of the Development Team. They decide how to build the "what." They are the experts who figure out the technical implementation, design, and tasks required to deliver the features. They manage the "How" in the Sprint Backlog.

HAW (How) in "Plan":
If "HAW" is interpreted as the "how-to" part of the plan, it directly relates to the execution phase in Scrum. The Product Owner provides the "what" (user stories in the Product Backlog), and during Sprint Planning, the Development Team figures out the "how" (breaking down the user stories into tasks in the Sprint Backlog).

Other Project Management Concepts to Consider
Since "HAW" is not a standard term, you might be thinking of one of these:

Agile: Agile is a broad philosophy or mindset for project management, outlined in the Agile Manifesto. It's based on values like collaboration, responding to change, and delivering working software frequently. Scrum is a specific framework that implements Agile principles.

Waterfall: This is a traditional, linear project management methodology. The "plan" is created in great detail upfront, and each phase (e.g., requirements, design, development, testing) must be completed before the next one begins. There is no flexibility to go back and change things once a phase is complete.

Kanban: This is another Agile framework, but it's focused on continuous flow. The "plan" is less about fixed sprints and more about visualizing the workflow on a board and limiting the amount of "Work in Progress" (WIP). When a team member finishes a task, they pull a new one from the backlog.

# Kanban
# The Pure Kanban Philosophy
In its purest, most theoretical form (as it came from Lean manufacturing), Kanban does not have a formal "backlog" in the same way as Scrum. The key principles of pure Kanban are:

Visualize the workflow: Use a board with columns to represent your workflow stages.

Limit Work in Progress (WIP): Set a maximum number of items for each column to prevent multitasking and bottlenecks.

Manage Flow: Focus on the smooth, continuous movement of items through the system, not on fixed iterations.

Pull System: When a team member finishes a task, they "pull" a new one from the previous column.

The idea is that there is a continuous queue of work that needs to be done, and the team simply pulls the next highest-priority item when they have capacity. This is different from Scrum's approach where a team "pushes" a pre-selected set of work (the Sprint Backlog) into a time-boxed sprint.
